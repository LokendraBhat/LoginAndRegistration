    <p style="color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘Electronic Governance’ or what is usually called e-Governance, uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as wide area networks, the internet, and mobile computing at various levels of government and the public sector to enhance governance. However, e-Governance and e-Government are terms that often cause confusion. “e-Government” is a system that uses ICT to enhance government operations and procedures with the goal of boosting civic engagement and effectiveness, whereas e-Governance refers to the functionality that uses ICT to enhance a range and quality of services delivered to the citizens.</p>
